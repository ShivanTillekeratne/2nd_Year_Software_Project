# AI Assisted Health Insurance Fraud Detection System
## Introduction
Rooted in the mission to combat fraudulent activities within healthcare
insurance claims, our system stands as a beacon of innovation, leveraging cutting-edge Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques.
Designed to be a robust and user-intuitive platform, our system aims to equip insurance companies with
the necessary tools to mitigate financial losses stemming from fraudulent claims effectively. Through
seamless cooperation with Mitra Innovations, our vision is to craft a unified solution that simplifies
processes, enhances data accuracy, and meets the diverse operational needs of insurance providers.

## Problem Statement
Fraud detection within the health insurance domain presents a multifaceted challenge, requiring a
combination of data analysis, technological advancements, and human expertise to mitigate financial
losses resulting from fraudulent claims. This problem is inherently complex due to the diverse range of
fraud patterns and the relatively small ratio of known fraudulent claims. However, leveraging Machine
Learning (ML) and other techniques offers a promising solution by enhancing predictive accuracy,
reducing costs, and achieving broader coverage with minimal false positive rates.

## Methodology
The proposed solution for the problem mentioned is an AI-assisted medical fraud detection system, which
is a comprehensive and adaptive system designed to effectively detect and prevent fraudulent activities
within the medical insurance domain. This system utilizes a combination of machine learning (ML)
models and a rules engine, allowing for dynamic rule adjustments to meet the specific needs of our
customers. Integrated with the Creatio software, our system accesses three key databases: claims,
customer, and fraud databases. The claims database serves as the primary data source for both the rules
engine and ML model, while the customer database facilitates relationship analysis through social network
analysis using the Facebook API. Two user roles, fraud investigators and admins, interact with the system
through a user-friendly web application dashboard, where they can input claim IDs for fraud detection.
The ML model processes the relevant claim data and provides detailed fraud detection outputs, which are
stored in the fraud database for future reference. Additionally, two REST APIs are employed to enable
seamless communication between the web application, Creatio software, and the business logic layer.
Ultimately, our solution aims to provide accurate fraud detection and efficient decision-making support,
enhancing the overall integrity and reliability of the medical insurance claims process.
