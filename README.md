losses resulting from fraudulent claims. This problem is inherently complex due to the diverse range of
fraud patterns and the relatively small ratio of known fraudulent claims. However, leveraging Machine
Learning (ML) and other techniques offers a promising solution by enhancing predictive accuracy,
reducing costs, and achieving broader coverage with minimal false positive rates.
